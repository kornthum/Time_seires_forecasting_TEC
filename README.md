# Time_seires_forecasting_TEC
This is one of my in-progress projects, so it may not be completely done. This project is built on Tensorflow-Keras framwork.

The full detail of the data can't be told because it is still in progress with my professor. This project mainly focuses on predicting the total electron content (TEC) by using various deep learning models such as DNN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU.Â 

FYI: Total election content negatively affects the communication system. It occurs in the ionosphere. So if we can predict the number of TEC, we will continue to maintain the communication system.

----------------------------------------------

**In-progress list:**

1.Adding more features to be trained.

2.Tuning the hyperparameters and layers (learning rate, batch size, number of hidden nodes, number of hidden layers)

3.Experimenting with Fast Iterative Filtering (FIF) and Sigular Spectral Analysis (SSA) as features

4.Training other models (DNN, CNN, and GRU)
